Plugin for ChatZilla which monitors torrent IRC announce channels, downloads torrent files based on a user-defined filter, and then sends the torrent files to a local or remote torrent client. Supports several different private trackers.

ChatZilla is normally used as part of SeaMonkey, or an extension to other browsers. However, it can also run under XULRunner, allowing ChatZilla to be used standalone, independent of a web browser.

Fixed bugs:
- Settings.js: "XML is not defined @ ...\Settings.js
- HttpRequest.js: "HttpRequest.sendGetRequestInternal: ex: Not Connected"
- Updated trackers list to v254
